How to work with Spring ORM? (vvvImp) [Refer to the attached design pattern image = How to.jpg]
	
	 We have HibernateTemplate which contains methods like Save, Update, Insert, Get, loadAll etc.
	
	 ProductDao (Dao) ---> HibernateTemplate ---> SessionFactory (Interface) <--- LocalSessionFactoryBean {We need to provide
																		DataSource, Hibernate Properties, Annotated Class }
		
	 Here, SessionFactory is interface, So, we'll provide object of LocalSessionFactoryBean in SessionFactory interface
